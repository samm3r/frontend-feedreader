# Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project you will see an application that reads RSS feeds from different fonts. Our main objective with this project is to create a consistent test suit with Jasmine. Testing is an important part of the development work. Trough them we can automatic check if our application is working properly or if we have something out of place.
